MTA Server Rules

   1. Role play at all times unless you're in admin-jail. Only administrators 
   are allowed to declare a situation to be OOC and/or interrupt an RP event.

   2. Do not deathmatch (DM). You must have a valid role play reason for attacking
   another player.

   3. Do not revenge kill (RK). If you reach 0 HP and respawn you are to role
   play memory loss of events leading up to the death. You cannot retaliate against
   the person or group that killed you.

   4. Do not metagame.

   5. No not powergame. In all role play situations both sides must have a say in
   the out come a situation.

   6. Do not use cheats or hacks. Hackers face a permanent ban.

   7. Do not exploit bugs in the script. Report the bug on the forum so it can be
   corrected.

   8. This is an English speaking server. If you wish to speak another language in
   character (IC) begin you text with the name of the language in square breackets,
   e.g "[Esp]". If you wish to speak another language OOC, do so through private
   messages.

   9. Don't mix out of Character (OOC) with In Character (IC). All OOC information
   is wrapped with double brackets ((example)).

   10. Respect all other players.

   11. Do not role play raping another player or paedophilia.

   12. Admin jail is OOC punishment therefore you are not allowed to role play in
   admin jail.

   13. Do not heal during fights.
 
   14. Do not bunny hop (jumping to get somewhere quicker).

   15. Role play car jackings. Pressing the enter button to throw the driver out 
   is not enough.

   16. Do not use abbreviations such as "lol, omg, wtf" in character.

   17. Do not leave the game to avoid death, losing a role play situation or medic
   bills.

   18. Do not provoke police into chasing you.

   19. Do not share you account with anyone.

   20. Do not transfer money between two of your own characters.

   21. Characters cannot share a name with a celebrities or characters from movies,
   TV shows, games, books or any other type of fictional material. Nicknames can not
   be used as ingame names. The name you submit has to be the one that would be on
   your character's birth certificate. "Bdawg" for instance is not a valid first
   name or surname. Nicknames can of course be used IC'ly.

   22. You must have Faction Reviews permission to start any government faction,
   official or unofficial.

   23. All scams but be carried out 100% In Character. That means you cannot lie OOC
   to scam someone IC. Adversely do not metagame that you are being scammed by
   asking question OOC.

   Admins instructions are final. If an admins instructions goes against server
   rules press F12 to take a screenshot as proof in the event it becomes an issue.

   If in doubt, use common sense.
